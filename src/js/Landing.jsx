                        The success of how well the design of a product has been
                        integrated into its development can be determined by how
                        well the improvement of its experience can be measured.
                        This statement sounds great, however, it might be
                        jumping ahead a bit, and may be initially a bit too
                        broad for an opening statement without a bit of a primer
                        on UX.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lets step back and take a look at the statement from a
                        differient perspective. To be more precise, we need
                        quantifiable ways to measure qualatative properties.
                        Sounds like an oxymoron? Some might say it is. How does
                        one measure quality? Some have valuable insight on the
                        matter, while others may say it&#39;s a balance of art
                        and science or a right brain, left brain thing. We feel
                        like discipline is a better way to describe the craft.
                        One statement that we can most all agree on is that a
                        delightful experience is the goal. Defining what exactly
                        the experience is specifically, is both, a creative, and
                        a scientific process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, creating a delightful experience requires
                        knowledge of how decisions are made. Second, intuition
                        plays a significant role in determining the complex and
                        often subconscious set of decisions that a person might
                        make in interacting with a design. Third, and assuming
                        we are talking about an interactive product, the craft
                        of UX is the set of guidelines, or methods, that allow
                        us to better understand the decisions and possible
                        actions, which can be mostly guided by intuition, and
                        how we might improve, and/or guide, those design
                        decisions to allow for an improvement in the overall
                        interaction. Also, remember, the set of guidelines can
                        exist in either qualatative, quantitative, or both
                        states.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Naturally, quantifiable methods are inherintly somewhat
                        engineer friendly and they are mesurable by their very
                        fabric. Ok, good, so we can measure quantifiable data.
                        So how do we measure qualatative data and even more
                        importantly, how do we present the data in a way that
                        improvements are measurable? The discipline of UX design
                        sets out to addresses this question. Furthermore, it
                        offers strategic ways of illustrating, interpreting, and
                        integrating
                        <em> (yes, we think oxford commas rock!) </em>
                        the various components of design and production which
                        can have tremendous benefit to the overall process of
                        how delightful products are made.
