                        The success of how well the design of a thing has been
                        integrated into development a thing can be determined by
                        how well the experience of a thing has been improved.

                        Creating a delightful experience requires knowledge of
                        how decisions are made; Intuition plays a significant
                        role in determining the complex and often subconscious
                        set of decisions that a person might make.

                        The craft of UX is the set of guidelines, or methods,
                        that allow us to better understand the decisions and
                        possible actions which are mostly guided by intuition,
                        and how to improve and guide design decisions to allow
                        for an overall improvement in experience.
