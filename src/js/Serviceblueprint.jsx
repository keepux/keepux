                        In UX, a service model blueprint is an extension of the
                        customer journey. Part of the blueprint maps out the
                        customer interactions while the other part maps out the
                        aspects of the products or service and how they relate
                        to the customer journey.

                        A service blueprint is typically represented in
                        swimlanes with each lane being represented by a specific
                        category.

                        Service model blueprints are helpful when needing to
                        articulate to stakeholders where specific bottlenecks
                        might exist and need additional investigation.
