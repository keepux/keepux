                        The UX development that went into this product included
                        converting static PDF assets into HTML and CSS and
                        creating a framework to support the desired usability.
                        This included a touch friendly interface and
                        mobile-responsiveness.

                        In many ways, UX development provided a great deal of
                        velocity to the development of this product and allowed
                        the main developer to focus on more functional
                        programming while appearnace and pixel-level obession
                        could be observied by the UX dev.

                        Many times there is insufficent asset preparation from
                        visual design and having a UX dev on the team can
                        eliminate these bottlenecks by having a team member that
                        is comfortable at the pixel level and can work with
                        other UXers and visual designers to communicate and
                        produce assets that can be loaded for visual inspection
                        in the next iteration.
