                        This is an example of mid-fidelity visual design. At
                        this level the stakeholder has confirmed a somewhat
                        perscriptive layout and may have already supplied the UX
                        dev with marketing assets such as product photography
                        and/or product descriptions. Having a UX dev on your
                        team is invaluable when communicating with the
                        stakeholders regarding assets. Many times the UX dev can
                        work with the stakeholder to produce additional needed
                        assets or communicate with the visual design for
                        specific design needs. This can make the project move
                        along much more smoothly.

                        Sometimes visual design takes a more unexpected turn and
                        a stakeholder presents a less mainstream idea which can
                        signifigantly increase the project complexities. A good
                        UX dev needs to be open to embracing creativity from
                        stakeholders while also listening carefully to the
                        desired outcome by the stakeholder. A good rule of thumb
                        is is ask, do you want it fast, good, or cheap? Choose
                        two.
