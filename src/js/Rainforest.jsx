                        Sometimes when working in UX development, previous
                        decisions have been made which can increase the level of
                        challange for realizing the proposed design. One of
                        these decisions is the frameworks for which a current
                        project already be running.

                        Such is the case with the Rainforest Partnership
                        project. The project runs on Joomla and by partnering
                        with the lead developer, the UX dev was able to create
                        the necessary code patterns to bring the new design to
                        life.

                        This is an example of a visual design that is provided
                        to UX dev as a reference for the layout and pixel level
                        placement of elements. Many times visual design may only
                        include one specific viewport which may reveal some
                        questions when addressing other viewports. Having a UX
                        dev on your team can reduce the design cycle needed for
                        additional viewports by creating alternative layouts
                        with the proposed assets which can kickstart revision
                        conversations and save overall development time.

                        Many times having a UX dev on your team is valuable
                        because a UI designer may not be specifically thinking
                        about call to actions from a UX research perspective but
                        may be looking at things from a UI composition
                        perspecitve. Sometimes, reorganzing a CTA might be
                        prompted during development as the projecet is created
                        and having an individual that can make these changes
                        quickly is invaluable.

                        Visual designers are invaluable when it comes to graphic
                        design, logo design, typeface selection, weight and
                        placement, and color pallete selections. At random
                        times, there may be a minor change here or there that is
                        needed by the UX dev but generally speaking a visual
                        designer is not a UX dev and the two have a symbiotic
                        relationship.
